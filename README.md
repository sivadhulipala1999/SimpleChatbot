# SimpleChatbot

This project aims to create a simple chatbot using the original Transformer architecture from the "Attention Is All You Need" paper by Vaswani et al. The dataset we use for training is the "Cornell Movie Dialogues Corpus". 

In case you would like to know further about the original Transformers architecture, I have attached a PDF of the handout I prepared for a seminar on Transformers that I gave, as a part of a group, for one of my modules at Leuphana University LÃ¼neburg.
